/* this funtion will take in the user choice for getting a fortune or getting
 * an affirmation.
 *
 * Fortune:
 * 	    need to randomly select the fortune
 * 	    need to return it
 *
 * Keep main small, allow the work to be done underneath
 * Basically this function needs to process the user's selection of clicking on  * the fortune, the connection between the UI and the Java code.n After processi * ng the user input, it will call  a function in the class Fortune to start the * assembly of the fortune text.
 *
 * I know we need Joel's help to connect the front end and the back end.  Do as  * much as you can of this without actually connecting the two. Pretend you have * connected it and act as though the inputs to the function calls have magicall * y been created in the functions from which they are called.  We need to get t * his part hashed out as concretely as possible with the understanding that we  * don't have all the dots connected yet.
 *
 * Please message me if anything isn't clear or if you have ideas to make this f * ile better! These are merely my ideas and I am interested in knowing your tak * e :)

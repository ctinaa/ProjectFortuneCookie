-So far we have decided that we want to code in Java.
-I have checked out free code camp, and it looks cool.  It seems like a good way to learn front end basics.  I think if I use it to learn new things, and also get to get my hands dirty by just trying some things with the project, I should be able to learn everything pretty well.
-I set up this repo so that we can have good version control while we are working
-I found some examples of implementing tries in Java that I think will be helpful
-I am trying to figure out how to get the project underway.  I know we need to get a few things done.

1. figure out what the UX will look like
2. figure out how we want to implement the database, and how we want to organize the text files
3. figure out the classes and heiarchy of the code
